# Lobster Protocol - Smart Contracts

## Core Concepts

### Rebasing
The vault is assigned the total value of the underlying assets, and it updates user balances based on the new total value of these assets. This mechanism ensures that user shares accurately reflect their proportion of the total vault value.

## Protocol Flow

1. **Initial Deposit**
   - User deposits assets into the vault (funds are immediately available for the algorithm but until the next rebase, the interests generated by this deposit are only distributed to the users who deposited before the last rebase -> negligible values)
   - Backend listen for deposit events and triggers a rebase (at least every hour, even if there is no new deposit / withdraw request). Once the new TVL is computed, a transaction updates the vault's Total Value Locked (TVL) (in eth). This transaction distribute their shares to the users who deposited between the last rebase and the current one. $newShares = (ethDeposit * totalShares) / totalEthManaged$
  
2. **Asset Management**
   - Deposited assets become immediately available to Lobster's algorithm
   - Algorithm periodically rebalance/update its positions to optimize yield based on market conditions
   - Each operation from the algorithm is verified by the Validator contract before being executed

3. **Withdrawal / Redeem Process**
   - User initiates a withdrawal request -> the shares they want to withdraw/redeem are locked.
   - Backend triggers a rebase event and send a transaction to updates the vault's TVL (in eth). Then, get the tokens back from uniswap, the user's locked shares are burnt and the corresponding eth amount is sent them to the users. The amount of eth sent to the user depends on the function called (redeem or withdraw). The amount of eth sent to the user is calculated as follows:
     - For withdraw, user select the amount of assets to retrieve
     - For redeem user select the amount of shares to convert and retrieve
   The retrieved eth amount is calculated as follows: $ethAmount = (sharesToBurn * totalEthManaged) / totalShares$
   
## Fee Structure

### Performance Fees
- Fixed percentage that can be updated by Lobster
- Collected during each rebase event

### Management Fees
- Fixed annual percentage that can be updated by Lobster
- Collected during each rebase event

### Deposit Fees
- Fixed value that can be updated by Lobster
- Deducted from shares before conversion to underlying assets
- Took into account when computing the new shares for the user
- Set to 0% by default
 
### Withdrawal Fees
- Fixed value that can be updated by Lobster
- Deducted from shares before conversion to underlying assets

## Technical Implementation Notes

All fee parameters are maintained as protocol constants but can be modified by Lobster governance through update. Fee collection is automated and integrated into the rebasing process to ensure consistent protocol revenue management.
